        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">About This Website</h2>
        <p>This website was created as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. Below is a brief overview of how I created this website using HTML, CSS, and version control with GitHub. I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my code editor and pushed the website files to GitHub for hosting.</p>

    <section class="container mt-5">
        <h3 class="text-center mb-4">Steps Taken to Create and Host the Website</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setting Up the Development Environment:</strong> I started by setting up VS Code. I made sure the folders and files were neat.</li>
            <li><strong>Writing HTML and CSS:</strong> Using HTML, I created the structure of the site (header, sections, footer) and used Bootstrap for responsive design. I then added custom CSS to make the site visually appealing. I did use some AI to help with some of the code, as front end is not my strong point.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control with Git:</strong> I initialized a Git repository within my project folder to track changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting the Website on GitHub:</strong> After creating a GitHub account, I created a new repository on GitHub.</li>
            <li><strong>Deploying with GitHub Pages:</strong> Finally, I enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings to host my website directly from GitHub. The website can be accessed using the URL provided by GitHub Pages.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="container mt-5">
        <h3 class="text-center mb-4">Issues I Faced</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relearning HTML and CSS:</strong> I had only worked with these languages in my first role, and this was at an editing level. So I had to use what I knew with the help of some AI.</li>
            <li><strong>Windows And Linux:</strong> I am using a laptop that runs on windows, but GitHub runs on Linux. This did create some errors. Such as the way each handle case sensitivity. </li>
            <li><strong>Sizing and spacing:</strong> I had to use a lot of trial and error to make sure the site was centre and everything was spaced correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Small syntax errors in HTML or CSS sometimes caused the site to break</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite these challenges, I gained valuable experience troubleshooting and learning new skills, which made me more confident in working with front-end technologies.</p>
